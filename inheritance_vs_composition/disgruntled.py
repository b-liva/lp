"""
The DisgruntledEmployee class doesnâ€™t derive from Employee, but it exposes the same interface required by the
PayrollSystem. The PayrollSystem.calculate_payroll() requires a list of objects that implement the following interface:

"""


class DisgruntledEmployee:
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

    def calculate_payroll(self):
        return 1000000
